# My very productive Processing class
These are Processing sketches I made during the winter semester 2018/19 at FH Potsdam

## Geometric graphics/patterns
![geometric patterns](/homework_07_Maria_kleeblatt/geometrischemuster.jpg)

With the use of sin/cos functions I created patterns which can be used for the laser cutter. Also I learned about SVG files and gained back some old math skills!

## Transformation of an unreadable dataset into a useful application
![suicide rates](/suicide_rates/suiciderates.jpg)

By using a downloaded dataset and arrays I wrote a program that searches through the dataset and displays the requested information.

**How does it work:** 

Hover over the picture of each generation and see in which country and year the suicide rates were the highest. You can differenciate between the statistics for men and women.

_EDIT: For this project I took the pictures from the internet, therefore I DO NOT own them._

## Insomnia simulator
![insomnia1](/insomnia_simulator/simulator.gif)

A interactive program that uses classes, arrays and for-loops to create an endless amount of stressmonsters, as they are hunting Pete, the protagonist of this program, in his sleep.<br/><br/>

The start menu explains the setting.<br/><br/>

![insomnia3](/insomnia_simulator/insomnia3.PNG)

The slide controllers can change the value of the opacity, speed, amount and size of the stressmonsters.<br/><br/>

With the help of variables the stressmonsters come in different shapes and sizes!

## Pizza Pong
![pizza](/multi_player/pizzapong3.jpg)

Pizza Pong is a version of Pong, but with an additional pizza making element. I used the minim library for the sound.

There were two Versions of the game. Version A was a basic single player game. 

**What's different in Version B:**
* a menu + how to play
* a multiplayer mode
* the pizza guy changes directions
* a back to menu button

_(Version A on the left; Version B on the right)_<br/><br/>

![pizza3](/multi_player/pizzapong2.jpg)

_(Multiplayer mode)_<br/><br/>

**Here are the rules:**

You play single or multi player pong. For each point your pizza gets more ingredients. 
You can win the game by earning 15 points and complete your pizza
or losing your 3 lifes and burn the pizza.

## Flying chess pieces

![chess1](/chess/chess1.jpg)

I created a 3D object (P3D) within a function, aka the chess piece, and made this interactive 3D animation, where the chess pieces increase their size with the frame rate. You can change the color, speed, direction and scale by clicking on the buttons. <br/><br/>

![chess2](/chess/chess2.jpg)

What started off as a bug, became a fun easter egg. When the value of the size variable become smaller than zero, the chess pieces reverse their direction and turn upside down. To underline that, I wrote an if statement, that in this specific case the colors background picture get inverted.

_EDIT: I was really creeped out by the design of this program, even though I wrote it myself. It may seem cute and fun an first, but the more you stare at it, the more uncomfortable you'll feel. As the chess pieces get bigger and bigger, you realize, these creatures came straight from hell._

## Kirchner's self portrait

![kirchner](/kirchner/kirchner2.gif)

I created shapes with with vertex, curveVertex and bezierVertex. The cigarette lightens up when it touches his mouth and by clicking with the mouse the woman in the background appears.
