# My very productive Processing class
These are Processing sketches I made during the winter semester 2018/19 at FH Potsdam

## Geometric graphics/patterns

With the use of sin/cos functions I created patterns which can be used for the laser cutter. Also I learned about SVG files and gained back some old math skills! 

## Transformation of an unreadable dataset into a useful application
![suicide rates](/suicide_rates/suiciderates.jpg)

Using a downloaded dataset and arrays I wrote a program that searches through the dataset and displays the requested information.

**How does it work:** Hover over the picture of each generation and see in which contry and year the suicide rates were the highest. You can differenciate between the statistics for men and women.
