# My very productive Processing class
These are Processing sketches I made during the winter semester 2018/19 at FH Potsdam

## Geometric graphics/patterns
![geometric patterns](/homework_07_Maria_kleeblatt/geometrischemuster.jpg)

With the use of sin/cos functions I created patterns which can be used for the laser cutter. Also I learned about SVG files and gained back some old math skills! 



## Transformation of an unreadable dataset into a useful application
![suicide rates](/suicide_rates/suiciderates.jpg)

Using a downloaded dataset and arrays I wrote a program that searches through the dataset and displays the requested information.

**How does it work:** Hover over the picture of each generation and see in which contry and year the suicide rates were the highest. You can differenciate between the statistics for men and women.

_EDIT: I do not own these graphics. I took them from the internet._



## Insomnia simulator
![insomnia1](/insomnia_simulator/simulator.gif)

A interactive program that uses classes, arrays and for-loops to create an endless amount of stressmonsters, as they are hunting Pete, the protagonist of this program, in his sleep.

The start menu explains the setting.

The slide controllers can change the value of the opacity, speed, amount and size of the stressmonsters.

With the help of variables the stressmonsters come in different shapes and sizes!
_EDIT: This time the graphics are made by me._
